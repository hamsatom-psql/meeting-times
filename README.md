# meeting-times

## Running the solution

1. build by executing in project root

```shell
./gradlew build
```

2. run Java application with main class [MainClass](src/main/java/org/MainClass.java)

You can change meeting parameters at [MainClass:30](src/main/java/org/MainClass.java)
and `findAvailableTime()` (both with/without type) is located
at [DefaultMeetingService](src/main/java/org/service/DefaultMeetingService.java).
